<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Management Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-premise</li><li>Cloud-based</li><li>Remotely hosted</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory Management Software can be classified into three main types based on their deployment options: On-premise, Cloud-based, and Remotely hosted. On-premise software is installed and maintained on the laboratory's local servers, providing full control and customization but requiring higher upfront costs. Cloud-based software is hosted on external servers, offering flexibility, scalability, and accessibility from any location with an internet connection. Remotely hosted software is similar to cloud-based, but data is stored on external servers managed by a third-party provider, reducing the burden of maintenance and support for the laboratory.</p></p>
