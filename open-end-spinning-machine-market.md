<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Open-end Spinning Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-venting Type</li><li>Pumping Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Open-end spinning machines are available in two main market types: self-venting type and pumping type. Self-venting type machines have a built-in ventilation system that removes dust and lint during the spinning process, reducing the risk of fire and improving air quality in the workplace. On the other hand, pumping type machines require an external ventilation system to remove dust and lint. Both types offer different solutions for managing dust and lint in the spinning process, catering to the specific needs of different spinning mills.</p></p>
