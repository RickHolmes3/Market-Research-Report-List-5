<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ​Alkali Silica Reactivity (AS) Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AS Inhibitors Contain Calcium Chloride</li><li>AS Inhibitors Not Contain Calcium Chloride</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Alkali Silica Reactivity (AS) Inhibitors are used in concrete to prevent harmful reactions between alkalis in cement and reactive silica in aggregates. There are two main types of AS Inhibitors based on their composition: AS Inhibitors that contain calcium chloride and AS Inhibitors that do not contain calcium chloride. AS Inhibitors containing calcium chloride are effective in preventing ASR but may accelerate corrosion of steel reinforcement. Non-calcium chloride AS Inhibitors offer ASR protection without the risk of corrosion, making them a preferred choice in certain applications.</p></p>
