<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surface Roughness Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>By Contract Type</li><li>Contact</li><li>Non-contact</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Surface roughness testers can be categorized based on their contract type as contact or non-contact testers. Contact testers use a stylus that physically touches the surface being measured, providing accurate results but potentially causing damage to delicate surfaces. Non-contact testers, on the other hand, use optical or laser technology to measure the surface roughness without touching the surface, making them ideal for fragile materials. Both types of testers are widely used in industries such as manufacturing, automotive, and aerospace for quality control and product development purposes.</p></p>
