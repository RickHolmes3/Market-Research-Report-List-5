<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Autotransfusion Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On Pump Transfusion Devices</li><li>Off Pump transfusion Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>On Pump Transfusion Devices refers to autotransfusion devices that are connected directly to the cardiopulmonary bypass machine during cardiac surgery, allowing blood to be collected, processed, and returned to the patient while the heart is still beating. Off Pump Transfusion Devices, on the other hand, are used in surgeries where the heart is not stopped and the patient is not placed on bypass. These devices collect and process blood outside the body, then return it to the patient during surgery. Both types of devices help reduce the need for donor blood transfusions and decrease the risk of complications.</p></p>
