<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire-resistant Spray Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Based</li><li>Solvent Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire-resistant spray materials are available in two main types: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based fire-resistant sprays are eco-friendly, non-toxic, and have low levels of VOCs. They are ideal for indoor use and in environments where odor and toxicity are concerns. Solvent-based fire-resistant sprays are more durable and provide a higher level of fire protection. They are commonly used in outdoor settings and industrial applications where strength and longevity are important factors. Both types offer effective fire protection, but their specific characteristics make them better suited for different applications.</p></p>
