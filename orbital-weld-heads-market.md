<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Orbital Weld Heads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Enclosed</li><li>Clamp-On</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Orbital weld heads come in two main types: enclosed and clamp-on. Enclosed weld heads are designed to fully surround the welding area, providing protection from external factors such as air and moisture. This type is often used in industrial applications where a clean, controlled environment is crucial. On the other hand, clamp-on weld heads are more versatile, as they can be easily attached to existing equipment for on-site welding tasks. This type is commonly used in situations where portability and flexibility are important factors. Both types offer their own advantages and are chosen based on specific requirements of the welding project.</p></p>
