<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Differential Pressure Flow Measurement Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Averaging Pitot Tubes</li><li>Nozzle Type Flow Meters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Differential Pressure Flow Measurement Systems consist of two main types: Averaging Pitot Tubes and Nozzle Type Flow Meters. Averaging Pitot Tubes utilize multiple pressure sensing points to measure the average velocity of a fluid flow. Nozzle Type Flow Meters, on the other hand, use a constriction in the flow path to create a pressure drop which is then correlated to the flow rate. Both types of systems are commonly used in industrial applications for accurate and reliable flow measurements.</p></p>
