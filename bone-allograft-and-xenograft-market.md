<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Allograft and Xenograft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Allografts</li><li>Xenografts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone allografts refer to bone grafts taken from a donor of the same species, usually human. This type of graft is commonly used in bone transplantation surgeries due to its high success rate and low risk of rejection. On the other hand, bone xenografts involve using bone tissue from a different species, such as bovine or porcine. While xenografts can be effective, there is a higher risk of rejection and immune response compared to allografts. Both types play an essential role in the bone grafting market.</p></p>
