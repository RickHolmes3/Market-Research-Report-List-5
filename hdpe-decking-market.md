<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HDPE Decking Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capped composite</li><li>Uncapped composite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HDPE decking comes in two main types: capped composite and uncapped composite. Capped composite decking has a protective outer layer that provides increased durability and resistance to stains, scratches, and fading. Uncapped composite decking, on the other hand, does not have this extra layer of protection, making it more susceptible to damage from the elements and everyday wear and tear. Both types offer a low-maintenance alternative to traditional wood decking, with capped composite being better suited for high-traffic areas and harsher climates.</p></p>
