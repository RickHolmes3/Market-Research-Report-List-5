<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chlor-alkali Ion Exchange Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Membrane with Sacrificial Thread</li><li>Membrane without Sacrificial Thread</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chlor-alkali ion exchange membranes are used in the electrolysis process to produce chlorine and caustic soda. Two common types of membranes in this market are those with sacrificial thread and those without. Membranes with sacrificial thread contain a thread that dissolves during operation, helping to maintain a constant gap between the electrodes. Membranes without sacrificial thread do not have this feature, but may offer other benefits such as longer lifespan or reduced maintenance requirements. Both types play a crucial role in the chlor-alkali industry.</p></p>
