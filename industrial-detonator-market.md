<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Detonator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prompt Detonator</li><li>Delay Detonator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial detonators can be classified into two main types: prompt detonators and delay detonators. Prompt detonators are designed to initiate an explosion immediately upon activation, making them ideal for precise timing in controlled blasting operations. On the other hand, delay detonators are programmed to initiate a blast after a certain period of time, allowing for sequential detonation in large-scale mining or construction projects. Both types of detonators play crucial roles in ensuring safety and efficiency in explosive operations.</p></p>
