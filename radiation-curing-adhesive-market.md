<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Curing Adhesive Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultraviolet Curing</li><li>Electron Beam Curing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation curing adhesives are categorized into two main types: Ultraviolet (UV) curing and Electron Beam (EB) curing. UV curing involves using UV light to initiate a photochemical reaction that causes the adhesive to harden. This process is fast, efficient, and environmentally friendly. On the other hand, EB curing uses high-energy electron beams to cure the adhesive by breaking chemical bonds and creating a crosslinked network. EB curing is preferred for heat-sensitive substrates and offers excellent adhesion properties.</p></p>
