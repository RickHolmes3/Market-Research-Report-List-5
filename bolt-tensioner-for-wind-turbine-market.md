<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bolt Tensioner For Wind Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-stage Tensioner</li><li>Multi Stage Tensioner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A single-stage tensioner is a type of bolt tensioner commonly used in wind turbines that operates using a single hydraulic stage to apply tension to bolts. On the other hand, a multi-stage tensioner for wind turbines utilizes multiple hydraulic stages to achieve higher levels of tension in bolts. Single-stage tensioners are simpler and more cost-effective, while multi-stage tensioners offer greater precision and control over the tensioning process. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the structural integrity and efficiency of wind turbine installations.</p></p>
