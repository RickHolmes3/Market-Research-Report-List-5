<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Theodolite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transit Theodolite</li><li>Non-transit Theodolite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laser theodolite market consists of two main types: transit theodolite and non-transit theodolite. Transit theodolites are equipped with a telescope that can rotate horizontally and vertically, making them ideal for measuring angles and distances in construction and surveying applications. Non-transit theodolites, on the other hand, only have a vertical rotation axis, making them suitable for more specialized tasks like monitoring structural movements or conducting geodetic surveys. Both types play a crucial role in providing precise measurements for various engineering and surveying projects.</p></p>
