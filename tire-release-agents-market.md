<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Release Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tire Release Agents with Silica Gel</li><li>Tire Release Agents without Silica Gel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tire release agents are classified into two main types based on the presence of silica gel. Tire release agents with silica gel are used to improve the rubber-to-metal adhesion process during tire manufacturing, as silica gel helps prevent sticking and facilitates easy release of the tire from the mold. On the other hand, tire release agents without silica gel are used in applications where silica gel may not be suitable or necessary. Both types of tire release agents offer effective mold release solutions for the tire manufacturing industry.</p></p>
