<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Converged System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Premises</li><li>Cloud</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Converged systems can be classified into two main market types: on-premises and cloud. On-premises converged systems are physical infrastructure that is installed and operated within an organization's own data center, providing a dedicated and secure computing environment. Cloud converged systems, on the other hand, are hosted and managed by a third-party service provider, offering scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness through a pay-as-you-go model. Both types of converged systems aim to streamline IT operations, improve efficiency, and simplify management for organizations.</p></p>
