<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zeolite Adsorbents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Regenerative Zeolite Adsorbents</li><li>Non-regenerative Zeolite Adsorbents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Zeolite adsorbents can be classified into two main types: regenerative and non-regenerative. Regenerative zeolite adsorbents can be reused multiple times after regeneration processes such as heating or purging, making them cost-effective and environmentally friendly. On the other hand, non-regenerative zeolite adsorbents are single-use and must be replaced once they reach their adsorption capacity, making them more suitable for applications where cost is not a major concern. Both types have their advantages and are used in various industries for adsorption purposes.</p></p>
